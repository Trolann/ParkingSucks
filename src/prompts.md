# What is this file?

These prompts were used but didn't fit elsewhere and we ~~needed~~ wanted to keep track of them 

## Comment prompt

Almost every file was ran through this prompt to generate standardized comments.
If it wasn't ran through this prompt it was because it was easily commented and we definitely
did it after we had this prompt and knew we would ask for it later.

### System message:

```Take in the given python code and output the same exact python code with added comments and logger statements.
Do not over comment but make sure major steps or complex statements are explained.
Use PEP8 standards and make docstrings for all functions.```

### User message: 
```Do not give me anything besides python code formatted correctly with the necessary comments.
Do not explain code, add ``` markdown ticks, or give me anything other than code which can
be pasted right back into the program with added comments```
