For mariadb:
USER_DB_USER=completions
USER_DB_PASS=1234
USER_DB_NAME=psskeds

Give me the command to create this user and db. The user should be able to insert and update. If it's possible to limit how a user could use the delete command, also give me a way where they could only delete with this query:
            DELETE FROM {self.table}
            WHERE dateadded < %s

this user should be able to select anything on the table

In python how can I easily salt and hash or encrypt and decrypt values I’m storing in a database? Assume I’m using MySQL.connector with a MariaDB (10.10)

I want to store a users class schedule in an encrypted way but be able to retrieve it in plain text

What kind of encryption algorithm does fernet use? Is it salted?

Fernet also includes a 128-bit timestamp in the encrypted message to ensure that the ciphertext cannot be decrypted if it is too old (by default, the timestamp limit is set to 60 seconds).

Explain this more.



Update this class to:
1) Have the following schema instead: id (primary key auto inc), username (unique), schedule, and dateadded
2) insert/update methods
3) A utility method which deletes all records with dateadded > 125 days old. This method should be called once a day, but can be run more often. Use threads or some other library if needed.


Update this to:
no longer worry about creating the table, remove it all, the table exist.

A method to return a schedule given a username.

The tablename is getenv("USER_DB_TABLE")

Add some into and error logging
