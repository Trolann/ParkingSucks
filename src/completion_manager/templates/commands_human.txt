Question: How is parking right now?
Step 1: It is currently Monday at 11:30. The user is asking about the present and needs the latest parking information.
Step 2: The user is not asking about a future date or time. I do not need to provide day of week or time of day. I must set get_average_parking_info to False.
Step 3: Getting the latest parking information will help the user find information about parking right now. I must set get_latest_parking_info to True.

```
get_latest_parking_info = True
get_average_parking_info = False
if get_average_parking_info:
    days_of_the_week = []
    time_of_the_day = ''
