I have a question about parking. I'll give you my question below and I need you to give me just the SQL query to get the results. You should return no markdown or other words, just the select and associated SQL commands

Make sure to use current date functions from SQL to query and return the 'name' columns with the results.

Example Question: "What is the average parking fullness for my class which starts at 9:30am?"
Example SQL Query:
SELECT CONCAT(MIN(fullness), '% to ', MAX(fullness), '%') AS expected_fullness_range
FROM sjsu
WHERE
    TIME(time) BETWEEN TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -90 MINUTE)) AND TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -30 MINUTE))
This is a good because it returns

Here's a bad example:
SELECT fullness AS percent_full FROM sjsu WHERE DAYOFWEEK(time) = 2 AND TIME(time) BETWEEN '09:00:00' AND '09:30:00'
This is bad because it doesn't return the 'name' column, so later LLMs can't tell the user information about the 4 garages.

Here's my question:

DO NOT REPLY WITH NOTES OR EXPLANATIONS. JUST A SQL QUERY TO RUN.

The SQL query and only the SQL query to answer this question is...
