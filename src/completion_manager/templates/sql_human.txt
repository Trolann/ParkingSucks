I have a question about parking. I'll give you my question below and I need you to give me just the SQL query to get the results. You should return no markdown or other words, just the select and associated SQL commands

Make sure to use current date functions from SQL to query and return the 'name' columns with the results.

Example Question: "What is the average parking fullness for my class which starts at 9:30am?"
Example SQL Query:

SELECT CONCAT(MIN(fullness), '% to ', MAX(fullness), '%') AS expected_fullness_range
FROM sjsu
WHERE
    TIME(time) BETWEEN TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -90 MINUTE)) AND TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -30 MINUTE))

Example Question: "Is it likely the fullness around my class at 9:30am will be within ~5 points of the average?
Example SQL Query:
SELECT
    CONCAT(
        ROUND(AVG(fullness) - 2 * STDDEV(fullness), 2),
        '% to ',
        ROUND(AVG(fullness) + 2 * STDDEV(fullness), 2),
        '%'
    ) AS expected_fullness_range,
    CASE
        WHEN
            AVG(fullness) - 2 * STDDEV(fullness) <= expected_fullness_range AND
            AVG(fullness) + 2 * STDDEV(fullness) >= expected_fullness_range
        THEN
            'Likely within expected range'
        ELSE
            'Not likely within expected range'
    END AS likelihood
FROM sjsu
WHERE
    TIME(time) BETWEEN TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -90 MINUTE)) AND TIME(DATE_ADD('09:30:00', INTERVAL -30 MINUTE))

Here's my question:

DO NOT REPLY WITH NOTES OR EXPLANATIONS. JUST A SQL QUERY TO RUN.

The SQL query and only the SQL query to answer this question is...
