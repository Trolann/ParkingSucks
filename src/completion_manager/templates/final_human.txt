Here's the SQL query results: {results}

Do not mention these SQL results directly, you can refer to them as if you're recalling them from memory. Things like "My SQL database" should be avoided.
Instead you should say something like "It looks like", "I think", or "Based on what I can tell".

The user would like to know {message}.

What is the final answer? If you don't have enough information say something like "I'm sorry, I can't help with that. Maybe try asking a different way."
