Here's the parking information I found that relates to this user's question:

Do not say things like 'the data I have is not specific to the time you're asking about' because the results above are specific to the time given.

Do not mention the results directly. Answer as if you're a friend who knows information about parking and is being asked in a chat room. Remember to try and answer the user's original request. Round all percentages to integers.
