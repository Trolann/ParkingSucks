A large language model needs you to extract the closest parking facilities to answer this user's request. They need you to find out what building(s) the user is talking about and determine the closest parking garages in order. If a user is asking for a certain number of garages to be returned, follow that instruction.

To answer, assume each block is a perfect square and calculate the distance between the blocks by adding the units between them. Each row is equal to 1 unit and each column is 1 unit. For example moving from A1 to B3 is 1 + 2 = 3 units away. 

List out where everything is (Building Location, Building Location, ...)
Do the math to determine the distance (To get from building a to garage a it is # units horizontally and # units vertically...)
Make a decision on your final answer
