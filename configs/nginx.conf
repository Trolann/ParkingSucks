# Prompts
# #1
# generate an nginx reverse proxy to route traffic to https://*.williamson-rfp.app
# to the appropriate container where * is the BRANCH_NAME generated from the Jenkins
# build file. Assume there is a wildcard certificate for the domain. Include the
# steps to start an nginx reverse proxy container in docker with the generated
# configuration. Include configuration to forward http to https.
# #2
# change this nginx config to route traffic from the jenkins subdomain to the docker
# container 'jenkins' at port 8080. All other subdomains should continue to go to
# the http://<BRANCH_NAME>-williamson-website-rfp:80; location.
